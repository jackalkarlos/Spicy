.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvirt\-admin\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... [\fICOMMAND_STRING\fP]
.sp
\fBvirt\-admin\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... \fICOMMAND\fP [\fIARG\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBvirt\-admin\fP program is the main administration interface for modifying
the libvirt daemon configuration at runtime, changing daemon behaviour as well
as for monitoring and managing all clients connected to the daemon.
.sp
The basic structure of most virt\-admin usage is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
virt\-admin [OPTION]... <command> [ARG]...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fIcommand\fP is one of the commands listed below. Any \fIcommand\fP
starting with \fB#\fP is treated as a comment and silently ignored, all
other unrecognized \fIcommands\fP are diagnosed.
.sp
The \fBvirt\-admin\fP program can be used either to run one \fICOMMAND\fP by giving the
command and its arguments on the shell command line, or a \fICOMMAND_STRING\fP
which is a single shell argument consisting of multiple \fICOMMAND\fP actions
and their arguments joined with whitespace and separated by semicolons or
newlines between commands, where unquoted backslash\-newline pairs are
elided.  Within \fICOMMAND_STRING\fP, virt\-admin understands the
same single, double, and backslash escapes as the shell, although you must
add another layer of shell escaping in creating the single shell argument,
and any word starting with unquoted \fI#\fP begins a comment that ends at newline.
If no command is given in the command line, \fBvirt\-admin\fP will then start a minimal
interpreter waiting for your commands, and the \fBquit\fP command will then exit
the program.
.sp
The \fBvirt\-admin\fP program understands the following \fIOPTIONS\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-connect\fP \fIURI\fP
.sp
Connect to the specified \fIURI\fP, as if by the \fBconnect\fP command,
instead of the default connection.
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-debug\fP \fILEVEL\fP
.sp
Enable debug messages at integer \fILEVEL\fP and above.  \fILEVEL\fP can
range from 0 to 4 (default).  See the documentation of \fBVIRT_ADMIN_DEBUG\fP
environment variable below for the description of each \fILEVEL\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.sp
Ignore all other arguments, and behave as if the \fBhelp\fP command were
given instead.
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-log\fP \fIFILE\fP
.sp
Output logging details to \fIFILE\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
.sp
Avoid extra informational messages.
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version[=short]\fP
.sp
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virt\-admin is coming from
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version=long\fP
.sp
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virt\-admin is coming from.
.SH NOTES
.sp
Running \fBvirt\-admin\fP requires root privileges due to the
communications channels used to talk to the daemon. Consider changing the
\fIunix_sock_group\fP ownership setting to grant access to specific set of users
or modifying \fIunix_sock_rw_perms\fP permissions. Daemon configuration file
provides more information about setting permissions.
.SH GENERIC COMMANDS
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Re)\-Connect to a daemon\(aqs administrating server. The \fIURI\fP parameter
specifies how to connect to the administrating server.
If \fILIBVIRT_ADMIN_DEFAULT_URI\fP or \fIuri_default\fP (see below) were set,
\fIconnect\fP is automatically issued every time a command that requires an
active connection is executed. Note that this only applies if there is no
connection at all or there is an inactive one.
.sp
To find the currently used URI, check the \fIuri\fP command documented below.
.SS uri
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uri
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Prints the administrating server canonical URI, can be useful in shell mode. If
no \fIuri\fP was specified, neither \fILIBVIRT_ADMIN_DEFAULT_URI\fP environment
variable nor \fIuri_default\fP option (libvirt\-admin.conf) were set,
libvirtd:///system is used.
.SH DAEMON COMMANDS
.sp
The following commands allow one to monitor the daemon\(aqs state as well as
directly change its internal configuration.
.SS server\-list
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
server\-list
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lists all manageable servers contained within the daemon the client is
currently connected to.
.SS daemon\-log\-filters
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
daemon\-log\-filters [\-\-filters string]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When run without arguments, this returns the currently defined set of logging
filters. Providing an argument will cause the command to define a new set of
logging filters.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-\-filters\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Define a new set of logging filters where multiple filters are delimited by
space. Each filter must conform to the form described in detail by
\fI/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf\fP (section \(aqLogging filters\(aq).
.sp
\fBExample:\fP
.sp
To define a filter which suppresses all e.g. \(aqvirObjectUnref\(aq DEBUG
messages, use the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ virt\-admin daemon\-log\-filters "4:util.object"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Note the \(aq.\(aq symbol which can be used to more fine\-grained filters tailored
to specific modules, in contrast, to affect the whole directory containing
several modules this would become "4:util"):
.SS daemon\-log\-outouts
.sp
\fBSyntax:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
daemon\-log\-outputs [\-\-outputs string]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When run without arguments, this returns the currently defined set of logging
outputs. Providing an argument will cause the command to define a new set of
logging outputs.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\-\-outputs\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Define a new set of logging outputs where multiple outputs are delimited by
space. Each output must conform to the form described in detail by
\fI/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf\fP (section \(aqLogging outputs\(aq).
.sp
\fBExample:\fP
.sp
To replace the current setting for logging outputs with one that writes to
a file while logging errors only, the following could be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ virt\-admin daemon\-log\-outputs "4:file:<absolute_path_to_the_file>"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To define multiple outputs at once they need to be delimited by spaces:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ virt\-admin daemon\-log\-outputs "4:stderr 2:syslog:<msg_ident>"
.ft P
.fi

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Retrieve server\(aqs threadpool attributes. These attributes include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIminWorkers\fP as the bottom limit to the number of active workers,
.IP \(bu 2
\fImaxWorkers\fP as the top limit to the number of active workers,
.IP \(bu 2
\fInWorkers\fP as the current number of workers in the threadpool,
.IP \(bu 2
\fIfreeWorkers\fP as the current number of workers available for a task,
.IP \(bu 2
\fIprioWorkers\fP as the current number of priority workers in the threadpool, and
.IP \(bu 2
\fIjobQueueDepth\fP as the current depth of threadpool\(aqs job queue.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBBackground\fP
.sp
Each daemon server utilizes a threadpool to accomplish tasks requested by
clients connected to it. Every time a client request arrives to the server,
it checks whether there is a worker available to accomplish the given task or
it should create a new worker for the job (rather than being destroyed, the
worker becomes free once the task is finished). Creating new workers, however,
is only possible when the current number of workers is still below the
configured upper limit.
In addition to these \(aqstandard\(aq workers, a threadpool also contains a special
set of workers called \fIpriority\fP workers. Their purpose is to perform tasks
that, unlike tasks carried out by normal workers, are within libvirt\(aqs full
control and libvirt guarantees that such a task cannot hang, thus will always
finish. An example of such a task this would be destroying a domain:

.sp
The upper limit to number of active workers in a threadpool. If used in
combination with option \fI\-\-min\-workers\fP, the value for the upper limit has to
be greater than the value for the bottom limit, otherwise the command results
in an error.
